    Calculates the integral of a polynomial.

    Parameters:
    poly (list of int/float): List of coefficients representing a polynomial.
        The index of each element represents the power of x for that coefficient.
        Example: [5, 3, 0, 1] represents f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 5.
    C (int/float, optional): Constant of integration. Default is 0.

    Returns:
    list of int/float: Coefficients of the integrated polynomial, including C as
        the first element. Whole numbers are converted to int.
        Returns None if input is invalid.
